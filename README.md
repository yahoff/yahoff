- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yahoff
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pharmacometrics, more specifically in population-based PK, PD, and TTE modeling. I use pharmacometrics approaches to support therapy individualization in gastroenterological disorders.
    Recently, I started developing software tools in RShiny to support clinical decision making.
